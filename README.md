Calculator to help visualize simple operations

## About
* Written by Pius Wong, pius@pioslabs.com
* Originally part of a FreeCodeCamp exercise in HTML/CSS/JavaScript
* Created Sep 19, 2017
* Modified through Jan 2018

## Purpose
This web app is meant to be a basic visual calculator that allows users to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers by pressing the appropriate buttons, just like a real, physical calculator. Another button will clear the screen. In addition, this app should also help users envision these operations on individual units or objects. I hope it helps people of all ages understand how to manipulate numbers better and attach meaning to these operations.

## Known Bugs
These are known bugs that should be fixed over time. They haven't been fixed yet due to being lower priorities:
* Division animations not yet completed
* Firefox, Edge compatibility: animations don't show up (units don't have height). Chrome & IE are OK (1/29/18)

## Desired Additional Features
* Choice of color scheme for positive and negative numbers
* Controller for animation speeds
* Negative sign should be applicable before number presses (this may require large coding changes)
* Alternate subtraction animation? If both numbers are the same sign, just take units them away. (Maybe give option)

## Miscellaneous
*The original project was named "Calculator Alligator" before I found out that a children's book already existed by that name.  I've changed it to "Calculator Gator" to disambiguate the names and because it is easier to say.
