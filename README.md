## Purpose
This web app is meant to be a basic visual calculator that allows users to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers by pressing the appropriate buttons, just like a real, physical calculator. Another button will clear the screen. In addition, this app should also help users envision these operations on individual units or objects. I hope it helps people of all ages understand how to manipulate numbers better and attach meaning to these operations.
