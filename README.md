Calculator to help visualize simple operations

## About

## Purpose
This web app is meant to be a basic visual calculator that allows users to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers by pressing the appropriate buttons, just like a real, physical calculator. Another button will clear the screen. In addition, this app should also help users envision these operations on individual units or objects. I hope it helps people of all ages understand how to manipulate numbers better and attach meaning to these operations.

## Known Bugs
These are known bugs that should be fixed over time. They haven't been fixed yet due to being lower priorities:
* When a second number is needed, and you attempt to change the sign, then press a digit, an extra, unnecessary "fraction" unit appears first.  This needs to be eliminated. (10/8/17)
* Typing (or clicking) digits too fast makes the visualizations not appear correctly. The animations seem to get in the way of proper processing. (10/8/17)
* Small decimal numbers show up funny when including more and more digits - square, circle, and fractional types might mix inappropriately. (10/8/17)
* Unit labels don't show up properly on small screens. The fix should be to just hide the labels on small screens. (10/8/17)
* Large number visualizations are off by 1 unit; too small - this bug may be inconsistent. Animation error? (10/8/17)

## Miscellaneous
*The original project was named "Calculator Alligator" before I found out that a children's book already existed by that name.  I've changed it to "Calculator Gator" to disambiguate the names and because it is easier to say.
